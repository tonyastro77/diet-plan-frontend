# Diet Plan Webpage

You can check this webpage deployed [here:](https://fathomless-fortress-72861.herokuapp.com)

## Application

This Webpage aims to collect food nutritional values from the user and display information regarding the total calories eaten versus the suggested calories given by the user personal information such as height, weight, how active the user is and whether the user is aiming to lose, gain or maintain weight. Upon starting, the webpage will requested the user to login or create a new user which then redirects to the login page after completion.

### `Home Page`

The Home Page, which is the page where the user is taken after logging in, contains a chart, user progress and current day's (today) food values added by the user, either a complete new food information by pressing ADD in the table or selected from the already existant food in the Main Database by selecting the tab  "Food Database" from the left side bar and then adding a food value from there. All this is will be visible back in the Home page.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Installation

## Instructions to run locally

After cloning both repositories locally with 'git clone' [Frontend](https://github.com/tonyastro77/diet-plan-frontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/tonyastro77/diet-plan-backend), don't forget to install the dependencies with 'npm install'

After all the depencies have been installed in both dependencies locally, you then have to 'npm run build' in the frontend folder to then copy the 'build' folder and past it in the root folder of the backend.

Finally, once the build folder in pasted in the backend folder, from there run 'npm run dev' to start the application locally in the port 3001.
From the browser go to 'localhost:3001' address and you should be able to run this project locally.
