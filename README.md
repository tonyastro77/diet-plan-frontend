## Instructions to run locally only with .env file which is not provided here for security reasons

After cloning both repositories locally with 'git clone' [Frontend](https://github.com/tonyastro77/diet-plan-frontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/tonyastro77/diet-plan-backend), don't forget to install the dependencies with 'npm install'

After all the depencies have been installed in both dependencies locally you have to 'npm run build' in the frontend folder to then copy the 'build' folder and paste it in the root folder of the backend.

Finally, once the build folder is pasted in the backend folder, add the .env file with the correct environmental files pointing the mongodb_uri, port and secret. From the root folder then run 'npm run dev' to start the application locally in the port 3001.
